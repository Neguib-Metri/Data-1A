#include <stdio.h> // this is a library and is used to add default functions to the language
#constant // a record is a value that never changes in the program until a new value is defined for it
# volatile // Variable whose value is modified externally
# Pointers // a pointer is a memory address of a thing or file on the computer
{#int // to be able to declare a variable or a constant (integer) it is necessary to use the int function.
#Float // to be able to declare a variable or a constant (decimals) it is necessary to use the int function.
# char // Character or small integer (byte)
#double // Floating point (mayor rank that float)
#void // No type (special use)
} // floating a; int b, c; character character;
#main () // is characterized by being the main function of the code. void main () or int main ()
#identifier // an identifier is any unreserved word that begins with a letter or an underline, and may contain letters, numbers and underlines inside. The maximum length of an identifier depends on the compiler that is used, but it is usually 32 characters.
#Modifiers // signed char int signed (default) // unsigned char int (unsigned) // long int (Long) // short int (Short)
#AriticOperators // ++ Increase. --Decrement. * Multiplication. /Division. % Module + Sum. -Subtraction.
#RationalOperators // <less than. > Mayor that. <= less than. > = greater than. == same. =! not the same. && too.
#Sizeof // The sizeof operator is a compile-time operator. The sizeof operator returns the size of a variable or type of data during compilation, not during program execution.
#Structuresofcontrol: // IF (clause or conditional to comply) else (the negative case of not complying with the conditional if) for (counter) (while) execute an action with a dowhile condition (execute while the condition is always met) switch(cases this operator is used in especific cases "predeterminated")
#Array // Set of numbers.
#Argc // integer, which Contains the number of arguments that have been entered.
#Argv // array,array of character pointers.
#printf // is used to display on screen any "impression" of a variable or result
#scanf // allows you to read the data provided by the user.
